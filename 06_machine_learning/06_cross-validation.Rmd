# Cross validation

In this lecture we introduce **cross validation**, one of the most important ideas in machine learning. Here we focus on the conceptual and mathematical aspects. We will describe how to implement cross validation in practice with the **caret** package. To motivate the concept, we will use the two predictor digits data presented in previous lectures and focus on using k-nearest neighbors (kNN), although cross validation can be used for any machine learning algorithm.

## Motivation with k-nearest neighbors

Let's start by loading the data and showing a plot of the predictors with outcome represented with color.

```{r mnist-27-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data("mnist_27")
mnist_27$test%>% ggplot(aes(x_1, x_2, color = y)) +  geom_point()
```

We will use these data to estimate the conditional probability function 

$$
p(x_1, x_2) = \mbox{Pr}(Y=1 \mid X_1=x_1 , X_2 = x_2).
$$

With k-nearest neighbors (kNN) we estimate $p(x_1, x_2)$. However, as we will see, kNN is easier to adapt to multiple dimensions. First we define the distance between all observations based on the features. Then, for any point $(x_1,x_2)$ for which we want an estimate of $p(x_1, x_2)$, we look for the $k$ nearest points to $(x_1,x_2)$ and then take an average of the 0s and 1s associated with these points. We refer to the set of points used to compute the average as the _neighborhood_. Due to the connection we described earlier between conditional expectations and conditional probabilities, this gives us a $\hat{p}(x_1,x_2)$. We can control the flexibility of our estimate, in this case through the $k$ parameter: larger $k$s result in smoother estimates, while smaller $k$s result in more flexible and more "wiggly" estimates. 

To implement the algorithm, we can use the `knn3` function from the __caret__ package. Looking at the help file for this package, we see that we can call it in one of two ways. We will use the first in which we specify a _formula_ and a data frame. The data frame contains all the data to be used. The formula has the form `outcome ~ predictor_1 + predictor_2 + predictor_3` and so on. Therefore, we would type `y ~ x_1 + x_2`. If we are going to use all the predictors, we can use the `.` like this `y ~ .`. The final call looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knn_fit <- knn3(y ~ ., data = mnist_27$train)
```

For this function, we also need to pick a parameter: the number of neighbors to include. Let's start with the default $k=5$. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(caret)
knn_fit <- knn3(y ~ ., data = mnist_27$train, k = 5)
```

In this case, since our dataset is balanced and we care just as much about sensitivity as we do about specificity, we will use accuracy to quantify performance.

The `predict` function for `knn` produces a probability for each class. We keep the probability of being a 7 as the estimate $\hat{p}(x_1, x_2)$

```{r}
y_hat_knn <- predict(knn_fit, mnist_27$test, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(y_hat_knn, mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
```

Let's plot $\hat{p}(x_1, x_2)$ and compare it to the true conditional probability $p(x_1, x_2)$:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# We use this function to plot the estimated conditional probabilities
plot_cond_prob <- function(p_hat=NULL){
  tmp <- mnist_27$true_p
  if(!is.null(p_hat)){
    tmp <- mutate(tmp, p=p_hat)
  }
  tmp %>% ggplot(aes(x_1, x_2, z=p, fill=p)) +
  geom_raster(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors=c("#F8766D","white","#00BFC4")) +
  stat_contour(breaks=c(0.5),color="black")
}
```


```{r knn-fit, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
p1 <- plot_cond_prob() + ggtitle("True conditional probability")

p2 <- plot_cond_prob(predict(knn_fit, mnist_27$true_p)[,2]) +
  ggtitle("kNN-5 estimate")
library(gridExtra)

grid.arrange(p2, p1, nrow=1)
``` 

We see that kNN adapts to the non-linear shape of $p(x_1, x_2)$. However, our estimate has some islands of blue in the red area, which intuitively does not make much sense. This is due to what we call _over-training_. We describe over-training in detail below. Over-training is the reason that we have higher accuracy in the train set compared to the test set:

```{r}
y_hat_knn <- predict(knn_fit, mnist_27$train, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(y_hat_knn, mnist_27$train$y)$overall["Accuracy"]

y_hat_knn <- predict(knn_fit, mnist_27$test, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(y_hat_knn, mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
```


### Over-training 

Over-training is at its worst when we set $k=1$. With $k=1$, the estimate for each $(x_1, x_2)$ in the training set is obtained with just the $y$ corresponding to that point. In this case, if the $(x_1, x_2)$ are unique, we will obtain perfect accuracy in the training set because each point is used to predict itself. Remember that if the predictors are not unique and have different outcomes for at least one set of predictors, then it is impossible to predict perfectly. 

Here we fit a kNN model with $k=1$:

```{r}
knn_fit_1 <- knn3(y ~ ., data = mnist_27$train, k = 1)
y_hat_knn_1 <- predict(knn_fit_1, mnist_27$train, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(y_hat_knn_1, mnist_27$train$y)$overall[["Accuracy"]]
```

However, the test set accuracy is actually worse than logistic regression:

```{r}
y_hat_knn_1 <- predict(knn_fit_1, mnist_27$test, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(y_hat_knn_1, mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
```

We can see the over-fitting problem in this figure. 

```{r knn-1-overfit, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
p1 <- mnist_27$true_p %>% 
  mutate(knn = predict(knn_fit_1, newdata = .)[,2]) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mnist_27$train, aes(x_1, x_2, color= y),
             pch=21, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors=c("#F8766D","white","#00BFC4")) +
  stat_contour(aes(x_1, x_2, z = knn), breaks=c(0.5), color="black") +
  ggtitle("Train set")

p2 <- mnist_27$true_p %>% 
  mutate(knn = predict(knn_fit_1, newdata = .)[,2]) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mnist_27$test, aes(x_1, x_2, color= y), 
             pch=21, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors=c("#F8766D","white","#00BFC4")) +
  stat_contour(aes(x_1, x_2, z = knn), breaks=c(0.5), color="black") +
  ggtitle("Test set")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=1)
``` 

The black curves denote the decision rule boundaries.  

The estimate $\hat{p}(x_1, x_2)$ follows the training data too closely (left). You can see that in the training set, boundaries have been drawn to perfectly surround a single red point in a sea of blue. Because most points $(x_1, x_2)$ are unique, the prediction is either 1 or 0 and the prediction for that point is the associated label. However, once we introduce the training set (right), we see that many of these small islands now have the opposite color and we end up making several incorrect predictions.

### Over-smoothing

Although not as badly as with the previous examples, we saw that with $k=5$ we also over-trained. Hence, we should consider a larger $k$. Let's try, as an example, a much larger number: $k=401$. 

```{r}
knn_fit_401 <- knn3(y ~ ., data = mnist_27$train, k = 401)
y_hat_knn_401 <- predict(knn_fit_401, mnist_27$test, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(y_hat_knn_401, mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
```

This size of $k$ is so large that it does not permit enough flexibility. We call this _over-smoothing_. 


### Picking the $k$ in kNN

So how do we pick $k$? In principle we want to pick the $k$ that maximizes accuracy (for classification), or minimizes the expected MSE (mean squared error; for regression). The goal of cross validation is to estimate these quantities for any given algorithm and set of tuning parameters such as $k$. To understand why we need a special method to do this let's repeat what we did above but for different values of $k$:

```{r}
ks <- seq(3, 251, 2)
```

We do this using  `map_df` function to repeat the above for each one. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(purrr)
accuracy <- map_df(ks, function(k){
  fit <- knn3(y ~ ., data = mnist_27$train, k = k)
  
  y_hat <- predict(fit, mnist_27$train, type = "class")
  cm_train <- confusionMatrix(y_hat, mnist_27$train$y)
  train_error <- cm_train$overall["Accuracy"]
  
  y_hat <- predict(fit, mnist_27$test, type = "class")
  cm_test <- confusionMatrix(y_hat, mnist_27$test$y)
  test_error <- cm_test$overall["Accuracy"]
  
  tibble(train = train_error, test = test_error)
})
```

Note that we estimate accuracy by using both the training set and the test set. We can now plot the accuracy estimates for each value of $k$:

```{r accuracy-vs-k-knn, echo=FALSE}
accuracy %>% mutate(k = ks) %>%
  gather(set, accuracy, -k) %>%
  mutate(set = factor(set, levels = c("train", "test"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(k, accuracy, color = set)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() 
```

First, note that the estimate obtained on the training set is generally higher than the estimate obtained with the test set, with the difference larger for larger values of $k$. This is due to over-training. Also note that the accuracy versus $k$ plot is quite jagged. We do not expect this because small changes in $k$ should not affect the algorithm's performance too much. **The jaggedness is explained by the fact that the accuracy is computed on a sample and therefore is a random variable**. This demonstrates why we prefer to minimize the expected loss rather than the loss we observe with one dataset. 

If we were to use these estimates to pick the $k$ that maximizes accuracy, we would use the estimates built on the test data:

```{r}
ks[which.max(accuracy$test)]
max(accuracy$test)
```

Another reason we need a better estimate of accuracy is that if we use the test set to pick this $k$, we should not expect the accompanying accuracy estimate to extrapolate to the real world. This is because even here we broke a golden rule of machine learning: we selected the $k$ using the test set. Cross validation also provides an estimate that takes this into account.

## Mathematical description of cross validation

In a previous lecture, we described that a common goal of machine learning is to find an algorithm that produces predictors $\hat{Y}$ for an outcome $Y$ that minimizes the MSE:

$$
\mbox{MSE} = \mbox{E}\left\{ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{Y}_i - Y_i)^2 \right\}
$$

When all we have at our disposal is one dataset, we can estimate the MSE with the observed MSE like this:

$$
\hat{\mbox{MSE}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$

These two are often referred to as the _true error_ and _apparent error_, respectively.

There are two important characteristics of the apparent error we should always keep in mind:

1. Because our data is random, the apparent error is a random variable. For example, the dataset we have may be a random sample from a larger population. An algorithm may have a lower apparent error than another algorithm due to luck.

2. If we train an algorithm on the same dataset that we use to compute the apparent error, we might be overtraining. In general, when we do this, the apparent error will be an underestimate of the true error. We will see an extreme example of this with k-nearest neighbors.

Cross validation is a technique that permits us to alleviate both these problems. To understand cross validation, it helps to think of the true error, a theoretical quantity, as the average of many apparent errors obtained by applying the algorithm to $B$ new random samples of the data, none of them used to train the algorithm. We think of the true error as:

$$
\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left(\hat{y}_i^b - y_i^b\right)^2 
$$

with $B$ a large number that can be thought of as practically infinite. 
As already mentioned, this is a theoretical quantity because we only have available one set of outcomes: $y_1, \dots, y_n$. Cross validation is based on the idea of imitating the theoretical setup above as best we can with the data we have. To do this, we have to generate a series of different random samples. There are several approaches we can use, but the general idea for all of them is to randomly generate smaller datasets that are not used for training, and instead used to estimate the true error.

## K-fold cross validation

```{r, include=FALSE}
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "500px",
                        out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"')
} else{
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "35%")
}
```

The approach we will focus on is _K-fold cross validation_. 
Generally speaking, a machine learning challenge starts with a dataset (blue in the image below). We need to build an algorithm using this dataset that will eventually be used in completely independent datasets (orange).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-1.png")
```

But we don't get to see these independent datasets. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-2.png")
```

So to imitate this situation, we carve out a piece of our dataset and pretend it is an independent dataset: we divide the dataset into a _training set_ (blue) and a _test set_ (red). We will train our algorithm exclusively on the training set and use the test set only for evaluation purposes.

We usually try to select a small piece of the dataset so that we have as much data as possible to train. However, we also want the test set to be large so that we obtain a stable estimate of the loss without fitting an impractical number of models. Typical choices are to use 10%-20% of the data for testing. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-3.png")
```

Let's reiterate that it is indispensable that we not use the test set at all: not for filtering out rows, not for selecting features, nothing! 

Now this presents a new problem because for most machine learning algorithms we need to select parameters, for example the number of neighbors $k$ in k-nearest neighbors. Here, we will refer to the set of parameters as $\lambda$. We need to optimize algorithm parameters without using our test set and we know that if we optimize and evaluate on the same dataset, we will overtrain.  This is where cross validation is most useful.

For each set of algorithm parameters being considered, we want an estimate of the MSE and then we will choose the parameters with the smallest MSE. Cross validation provides this estimate.

First, before we start the cross validation procedure, it is important to fix all the algorithm parameters. Although we will train the algorithm on the set of training sets, the parameters $\lambda$ will be the same across all training sets. We will use $\hat{y}_i(\lambda)$ to denote the predictors obtained when we use parameters $\lambda$.

So, if we are going to imitate this definition:


$$
\mbox{MSE}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left(\hat{y}_i^b(\lambda) - y_i^b\right)^2 
$$

we want to consider datasets that can be thought of as an independent random sample and we want to do this several times. With K-fold cross validation, we do it $K$ times. In the pictures, we are showing an example that uses $K=5$. 

We will eventually end up with $K$ samples, but let's start by describing how to construct the first: we simply pick $M=N/K$ observations at random (we round if $M$ is not a round number) and think of these as a random sample $y_1^b, \dots, y_M^b$, with $b=1$. We call this the validation set:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-4.png")
```

Now we can fit the model in the training set, then compute the apparent error on the independent set:

$$
\hat{\mbox{MSE}}_b(\lambda) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \left(\hat{y}_i^b(\lambda) - y_i^b\right)^2 
$$

Note that this is just one sample and will therefore return a noisy estimate of the true error. This is why we take $K$ samples, not just one. In K-fold cross validation, we randomly split the observations into $K$ non-overlapping sets:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-5.png")
```


Now we repeat the calculation above for each of these sets $b=1,\dots,K$ and obtain $\hat{\mbox{MSE}}_1(\lambda),\dots, \hat{\mbox{MSE}}_K(\lambda)$. Then, for our final estimate, we compute the average:

$$
\hat{\mbox{MSE}}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^K \hat{\mbox{MSE}}_b(\lambda)
$$

and obtain an estimate of our loss. A final step would be to select the $\lambda$ that minimizes the MSE.

We have described how to use cross validation to optimize parameters. However, we now have to take into account the fact that the optimization occurred on the training data and therefore we need an estimate of our final algorithm based on data that was not used to optimize the choice. Here is where we use the test set we separated early on:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-6.png")
```

We can do cross validation again:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-7.png")
```

and obtain a final estimate of our expected loss. However, note that this means that our entire compute time gets multiplied by $K$. You will soon learn that performing this task takes time because we are performing many complex computations. As a result, we are always looking for ways to reduce this time. For the final evaluation, we often just use the one test set.

Once we are satisfied with this model and want to make it available to others, we could refit the model on the entire dataset, without changing the optimized parameters.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv-8.png")
```


Now how do we pick the cross validation $K$? Large values of $K$ are preferable because the training data better imitates the original dataset. However, larger values of $K$ will have much slower computation time: for example, 100-fold cross validation will be 10 times slower than 10-fold cross validation. For this reason, the choices of $K=5$ and $K=10$ are popular.

One way we can improve the variance of our final estimate is to take more samples. To do this, we would no longer require the training set to be partitioned into non-overlapping sets. Instead, we would just pick $K$ sets of some size at random.

One popular version of this technique, at each fold, picks observations at random with replacement (which means the same observation can appear twice). This approach has some advantages (not discussed here) and is generally referred to as the _bootstrap_. In fact, this is the default approach in the __caret__ package.  We describe how to implement cross validation with the __caret__ package next.

## Example: kNN

When an algorithm includes a tuning parameter, `train` automatically uses cross validation to decide among a few default values. To find out what parameter or parameters are optimized, you can read the [manual](http://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html) or study the output of: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getModelInfo("knn")
```

We can also use a quick lookup like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
modelLookup("knn")
```

If we run it with default values: 

```{r}
train_knn <- train(y ~ ., method = "knn", data = mnist_27$train)
```

you can quickly see the results of the cross validation using the `ggplot` function. The argument `highlight` highlights the max:

```{r caret-highlight}
ggplot(train_knn)
```

By default, the cross validation is performed by taking 25 bootstrap samples comprised of 25% of the observations. For the `kNN` method, the default is to try $k=5,7,9$. We change this using the `tuneGrid` parameter. The grid of values must be supplied by a data frame with the parameter names as specified in the `modelLookup` output. 

Here, we present an example where we try out 30 values between 9 and 67. To do this with __caret__, we need to define a column named `k`, so we use this: 
`data.frame(k = seq(9, 67, 2))`.

Note that when running this code, we are fitting 30 versions of kNN to 25 bootstrapped samples. Since we are fitting $30 \times 25 = 750$ kNN models, running this code will take several seconds. We set the seed because cross validation is a random procedure and we want to make sure the result here is reproducible.

```{r train-knn-plot}
set.seed(2008)
train_knn <- train(y ~ ., method = "knn", 
                   data = mnist_27$train,
                   tuneGrid = data.frame(k = seq(9, 71, 2)))
ggplot(train_knn)
```

To access the parameter that maximized the accuracy, you can use this:

```{r}
train_knn$bestTune
```

and the best performing model like this:

```{r}
train_knn$finalModel
```

The function `predict` will use this best performing model. Here is the accuracy of the best model when applied to the test set, which we have not used at all yet because the cross validation was done on the training set:

```{r}
confusionMatrix(predict(train_knn, mnist_27$test, type = "raw"),
                mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
```

If we want to change how we perform cross validation, we can use the `trainControl` function. We can make the code above go a bit faster by using, for example, 10-fold cross validation. This means we have 10 samples using 10% of the observations each. We accomplish this using the following code:

```{r cv-10-fold-accuracy-estimate}
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, p = .9)
train_knn_cv <- train(y ~ ., method = "knn", 
                   data = mnist_27$train,
                   tuneGrid = data.frame(k = seq(9, 71, 2)),
                   trControl = control)
ggplot(train_knn_cv)
```

We notice that the accuracy estimates are more variable, which is expected since we changed the number of samples used to estimate accuracy.

Note that `results` component of the `train` output includes several summary statistics related to the variability of the cross validation estimates:

```{r}
names(train_knn$results)
```

We can also see the standard deviation bars obtained from the cross validation samples:

```{r accuracy-with-sd-bars}
train_knn$results %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = k, y = Accuracy)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = k, 
                    ymin = Accuracy - AccuracySD, 
                    ymax = Accuracy + AccuracySD))
```
