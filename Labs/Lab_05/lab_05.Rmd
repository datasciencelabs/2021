In class we learned about probability through determining if a casino would lose money if they installed roulette wheels. In the game of [roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette) you can bet on several things including black or red. On this bet, if you win, you double your earnings. In this lab we will look at how the casino makes money on this. If you look at the [possibilities](http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/games/Roulette.png), you realize that the chance of red or black are both slightly less than 1/2. There are two green spots, so the probability of landing on black (or red) is actually 18/38, or 9/19.

### Question 1

Let's make a quick sampling model for this simple version of roulette. You are going to bet a dollar each time you play and always bet on black. Make a sampling model for this process using the `sample` function. Write a function `roulette` that takes as an argument the number of times you play, $n$, and returns your earnings, which here we denote with $S_n$.

```{r}
# Your code here
```

### Question 2

Use a Monte Carlo simulation to study the distribution of total earnings $S_n$ for $n = 100, 250, 500, 1000$. That is, for each value of $n$, make one or more plots to examine the distribution of earnings. Examine the plots, and describe how the expected values and standard errors change with $n$. You do not need to show us the plots. Just the code you used to create them. Hints: It's OK to use a for-loop. Think about the possible values $S_n$ can take when deciding on the `geom_histogram` parameters such as `binwidth` and `center`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Your code here
```

For the sums, the expected value decreases (becomes more negative) and the standard error increases with larger $n$.

### Question 3

Repeat Problem 2 but for the means instead of the sums. After you answer, describe the mathematical results that you can use to answer this without making plots.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Your code here
```


### Question 4

Now think of a sampling model for our casino problem. What is the expected value of our sampling model? What is the standard deviation of our sampling model?


### Question 5

Suppose you play 100 times. Use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to approximate the probability that the casino loses money. Then use a Monte Carlo simulation to corroborate your finding.

```{r}
# Your code here                 
```


### Question 6

In general, what is the probability that the casino loses money as a function of $n$? Make a plot for values ranging from 25 to 1,000. Why does the casino give you free drinks if you keep playing?


```{r}
# Your code here
