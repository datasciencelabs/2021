## Tidy data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
ds_theme_set()
```

To help define tidy data we will use the Gapminder data from the `dslabs` package that contains the health and income outcomes for 184 countries from 1960 to 2016. This dataset comes from the [Gapminder Foundation](http://www.gapminder.org/), an organization dedicated to educating the public by using data to dispel common myths about the so-called "developing world". The organization uses data to show how actual trends in health and economics contradict the narratives that emanate from sensationalist media coverage of catastrophes, tragedies and other unfortunate events. We'll dig more into the data in the visualization module, but for now let's plot fertility data across time for two countries: South Korea and Germany. To make the plot we use this subset of the data:

```{r}
data("gapminder")
tidy_data <- gapminder %>% 
             filter(country %in% c("South Korea", "Germany")) %>%
             select(country, year, fertility)
head(tidy_data)
```

With the data in this format we could quickly make the desired plot:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
tidy_data %>% ggplot(aes(year, fertility, color = country)) +
              geom_point()
```

One reason this code works seamlessly is because the data is _tidy_: each point is represented in a row. This brings us to the definition of _tidy data_: each row represents one observation and the columns represent the different variables that we have data on for those observations.

If we go back to the original data provided by GapMinder we see that it does not start out _tidy_. We include an example file with the data shown in this graph mimicking the way it was originally saved in a spreadsheet:

```{r, message=FALSE}
path <- system.file("extdata", package="dslabs")
filename <- file.path(path,  "fertility-two-countries-example.csv")
wide_data <- read_csv(filename)
```

The object `wide_data` includes the same information as the object `tidy_data` except it is in a different format: a `wide` format. Here are the first nine columns:

```{r}
select(wide_data, country, `1960`:`1967`)
```

There are two important differences between the wide and tidy formats. First, in the wide format, each row includes several observations. Second, one of the variables, year, is stored in the header.
 
The `ggplot` code we introduced earlier no longer works here. For one there is no `year` variable. So to use the `tidyverse` we need to wrangle this data into `tidy` format.
